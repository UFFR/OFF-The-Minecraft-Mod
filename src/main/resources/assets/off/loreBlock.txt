Compressed low quality metal
Metal coated bricks
Weaker than metal blocks, but stronger than normal bricks
A nice building material
From a mysterious tree that lives in the Nothingness
It has been depleted of smoke, it's like a brittle sponge
A curious brightly colored cube...
Its bright colors clash with the environment, going against any form of the plastic arts
Yellow-colored rock unique to Zone 0, no benefit other than differing color choice
